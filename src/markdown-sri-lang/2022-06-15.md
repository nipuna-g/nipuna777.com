#### Definition of Done - Revisited

I attempted to come up with a definition for done in my first blog post about sri-lang.

Not that I have a bit more of an idea on what I want to do before releasing the first version, I think it's time to expand on the definition.

These are the things I need to finish before launching the v1 of Sri-Lang.

#### Step 1 - Finalize the syntax
*   Have a language that can be used to teach the ICT syllabus in Sinhalese
    * Create enough examples in JS to cover the ICT syllabus
    * Convert it to Sinhala syntax that makes sense
        * In written Sinhalese(not spoken)
        * Sinhalese grammar event if that means diverging from the traditional syntax
    * Document the finalized keywords from the above exercise

#### Step 2 - Build the interpreter
*   Be able to execute code examples locally

#### Step 3 - Build the IDE   
* Have a web-ide where users can play around with the language

#### Step 4 - Launch
* Integrate web-ide to sri-lang page
* Come up with a 'marketing' site
* Update readme.md
* Create a logo
* Web page should have
    * Landing page - quick video intro
    * Documentation(from step 1)
    * Playground (home page +)

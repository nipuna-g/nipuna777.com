I love the great introduction to 'The Parts of a Language' from the book 'Crafting Interpreters' by Robert Nystrom.

This image shows how we can build a programming language.

#### How to build a language

You start with the source-code and scan to extract the tokens. After that, you parse the syntax tree. Which can then be optimized, converted into an IR which can then be used to do optimizations and code generation. The 'code' in the final step is what will run on the users computer. 

This is a complex process and would take some significant effort to pull off. The book does go through building a full language with garbage collection. But to start off, I'd like to take a short cut.


#### Shortcut for v1

For the first version of the language, I'd like to skip most of this process and instead create a language that would transpile down to JavaScript. 

This would allow me to get something up and running quickly to experiment with the syntax. 

#### Tradeoffs

I believe having an easy to understand syntax, a web IDE and good tutorials is more important than having a 'proper' language.

Transpiling down to JS is the easiest way to play around with the syntax and the fastest way to get a web IDE. The tradeoff here is that 'Sri-Lang' would be bound by all the limitations of JavaScript

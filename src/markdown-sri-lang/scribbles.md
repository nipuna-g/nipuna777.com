### This is the space for tangential ideas

* Currently, I can't touch type in Sinhalese, I would like to write these notes(and sri-lang documentation) in Sinhalese, and getting better at typing would be part of it. 

*  There are multiple input methods for Sinhalese typing the two main ways being Wijesekara keyboard and the Phonetic keyboards. I feel like stenography like keyboard layout might work well for Sinhalese and similar languages. This might be worth investigating

* Code editors expect monospace fonts. Sinhalese(and similar languages) have varying character widths making any code(and other text) written using those languages somewhat unsightly. Is there a way around this? 

* I should work on learning Tamil. This would make v2 of this more meaningful.

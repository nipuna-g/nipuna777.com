There have been previous attempts at creating programming languages in Sinhalese. 

- https://github.com/RezSat/Ceylonicus
    - Python based language
    - Has a nice, working web-ide https://ceylonicus.vercel.app/#
    - Seems to be inspired by this [tutorial](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code)
- http://citrine-lang.org/
    - Seems to be the most popular language to support a large number of languages
    - Could not find a web IDE (Need to download and run locally)
    - The grammer seems to be fixed, this may not be great for Sinhalese grammer
- https://github.com/Ezhil-Language-Foundation/Ezhil-Lang
    - Tamil programming lang
    - Seems to be actively maintained
    - Has a paper on it https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.4960.pdf 
- https://github.com/Kalaam-Programming-Language/Kalaam
    - Hindi programming language
